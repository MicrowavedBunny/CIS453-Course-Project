                <p>Hi, my name is Jacob Davidson. I am 22 and I live in North Carolina.
                    Working to soon have a Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science with a Major in Software Development.
                    I have been passionate about computers from a very young age and have always wanted to pursue a career in the software development field,
                    more specifically the game development field. I have always dreamt of one day creating something that will make at least one person's life
                    a little bit better and make them smile. Many video games have made a lasting impact on my life and I am to one day create something like
                    that for others.</p>
